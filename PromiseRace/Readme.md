<https://leetcode.com/problems/promise-time-limit/>

Given an asynchronous function fn and a time t in milliseconds, return a new time limited version of the input function. fn takes arguments provided to the time limited function.

The time limited function should follow these rules:

- If the fn completes within the time limit of t milliseconds, the time limited function should resolve with the result.
- If the execution of the fn exceeds the time limit, the time limited function should reject with the string "Time Limit Exceeded".
